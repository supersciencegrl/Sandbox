This repo exists for me to just learn and play around with code, and store little snippets. 

### SQL
In Apr 2022, I completed the W3Schools SQL tutorial. The SQL notes I made from this course are here, stored as files named SQL_%. 
- _SQL_demo.py_ -- Basic SQL commands, using `sqlite3` (could be used as a cheatsheet)
- _SQL_test_create.sql_ -- SQL database creation and manipulation (could be used as a cheatsheet)
- _SQL_demo_create.sql_ -- A copy to recreate the Northwind test database
